# Overview of Cantera

![CanteraOverview.png](images/CanteraOverview.png)

## Property Calculator

* Set state of your phase object(s)
* Evaluate individual properties via function calls.

## "Canonical Simulations"

* Cantera comes pre-packaged with a number of simulation tools and examples for a limited set of 'classic' problems.
  * 0-D reactors
  * 1-D flames, flows, and reactors
* These models take user inputs for intial/inlet conditions, reactor geometry, etc.
* The model sets the state of Cantera objects and evaluating properties to provide terms required to solve/integrate conservation equations.

## Property evaluation for in-house simulation code

For more complex or novel simulations, the user writes their own simulation code.
* Establishes a solution vector to describe the system state
* Defines and codes conservation equations
* Writes calls to Cantera to evaluate terms in the conservation equations

# Application Areas

![Apps.png](images/Apps.png)

Cantera can be used in a wide variety of applications
* Combustion
* Electrochemistry
* Surface chemistry
* Non-ideal equations of state

Cantera's strength is that it is (relatively) easy to add new functionality

# Installation

Installation options are provided on the website: https://cantera.org/install/

> [!TIP]
> Additional instructions are posted in the [README.md](README.md) file.

## Cantera Python API

### Conda

The easiest and recommended way (if you have Anaconda/Miniconda installed).

- [Installation instructions](https://cantera.org/stable/install/conda.html#installing-with-conda)
- **Additional Conda packages required:**
  `jupyterlab`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `ipympl`, `python-graphviz`, `scipy`, `jupytext`

### Pip

Using Pythonâ€™s package installer, available in most Python environments.

- [Installation instructions](https://cantera.org/stable/install/pip.html#installing-with-pip)
- **Additional Pip packages required:**
  `jupyterlab`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `ipympl`, `graphviz`, `scipy`, `jupytext`

### Other approaches

- Ubuntu users can install the cantera-python3 package from the Cantera PPA.
- Fedora / Enterprise Linux users can install python3-cantera using dnf.
- OpenSUSE users can install packages using zypper.
- Gentoo users can install using emerge.
- FreeBSD users can install using pkg.
- If you want to use the current development version, or add features of your own, you should compile Cantera from source.

# Examples!

Examples are available from the Cantera documentation in several formats: https://cantera.org/examples/index.html

# Community Resources

## Google Group

Link: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cantera-users
  * Email questions to the whole user group
  * The developers watch this group pretty consistently
  * New posters' messages are moderated
  * Messages asking for help with code or error messages must include
    * The code and error message in the post itself (no images!)
    * Any YAML files required to run the code
    * The OS, interface, and version of Cantera you're using

## Documentation

* Documentation at https://cantera.org/documentation
* Has examples and API documentation

## GitHub
