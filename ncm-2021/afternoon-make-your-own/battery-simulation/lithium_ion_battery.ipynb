    " \n",
    "In this example we will illustrate how to calculate electric potential of a battery half-cell (focused on just one electrode--the anode), during charging of the battery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the thermodynamic model for the `BinarySolutionTabulatedThermo` class, used to descrige the intercalation of graphite, is presented in greater detail in the reference: M. Mayur, S. DeCaluwe, B. L. Kee, W. G. Bessler, \"Modeling thermodynamics and kinetics of intercalation phases for lithium-ion batteries in open source software\", _Electrochimica Acta_, *323*, 2019, p. 134797.\n",

    "\n",
    "The battery here, can be thought of as consisting of two particles--anode and cathode--connected by a liquid electrolyte:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"SingleParticleBattery.png\" alt=\"Cartoon of a Single Particle Battery Model\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity's sake, we will focus on just the anode particle and the adjacent electrolyte.  The state of the anode will be characterized by that of a representative/average anode particle. \n",
    "\n",
    "### State variables\n",
    "The state of our system is presented by the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\phi_{\\rm anode}$: electric potential of graphite anode.\n",
    "- $\\phi_{\\rm elyte}$: electric potential of electrolyte.\n",
    "- $X_{k,\\,{\\rm anode}}$: Mole fraction of intercalated Li in the anode.\n",
    "- $C_{k,\\,{\\rm elyte}}$: molar density of electrolyte species $k,\\,{\\rm elyte}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processes:\n",
    "There are four processes occuring in our simulation domain, each associated with the movement of electrical charge and a corresponding current $I$:\n",
    "- External applied current $i_{\\rm ext}$\n",
    "- Ionic current $i_{\\rm io}$ which brings Li$^+$ ions in the electrolyte phase into/out of the domain.\n",
    "- Electro-chemical reactions at the anode-electrolyte interface, with an associated Faradaic current $i_{\\rm Far}$.\n",
    "- Double-layer current $i_{\\rm dl}$, associated with the movement of charge between the bulk of a phase and the phase interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these processes impacts our state variables, in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"spm_interfaces.png\" alt=\"Cartoon of anode processes.\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note from the image that all current densities $i$ are defined as positive when they move positive charge toward the anode current collector. This will be important, below, when we define our residual function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "The primary two assumptions that we will make are:\n",
    "- The battery is isothermal (constant temperature).\n",
    "- The bulk interior of any phase is charge neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first assumption is straightforward enough, but the second requries a little explanation.  In electrochemical systems, charge buildup can occur at the interfaces between charges, but the interior of each phase is very nearly charge neutral, at all times.  If a charge imabalance occurs in the interior of a phase, it typically results in very large electric fields, which drive the charge toward neutrality.  Simply assuming charge neutrality, then, is a decent approximation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This has three main impacts on our simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the domain as a whole is charge neutral, that means that the external applied current $i_{\\rm ext}$ at any time is exactly equal to the ionic current $i_{\\rm io}$ entering the anode domain.\n",
    "2. At any given time, the faradaic current $i_{\\rm Far}$ is determined by the local state variables $\\phi_{\\rm anode}$, $\\phi_{\\rm elyte}$, $X_{k,\\,{\\rm anode}}$, and $C_{k,\\,{\\rm elyte}}$.  So there is no guarantee that $i_{\\rm Far} = i_{\\rm ion} = i_{\\rm elyte}$, which is required to maintain charge neutrality in the individual phases.  The double layer current, $i_{\\rm dl}$, then, is calculated at any given time as that required to maintain charge neutrality in the phases.  There is an equal and opposite movement of charges to the interface on either side of the phase bondary:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the anode phase:\n",
    "$$ i_{\\rm dl} = i_{\\rm Far} - i_{\\rm ext}$$\n",
    "or in the electrolyte phase:\n",
    "$$ i_{\\rm dl} = i_{\\rm Far} - i_{\\rm io}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From this, we know that the movement of Li$^+$ ions out of the bulk electrolyte to the anode or the interface, $i_{\\rm Far} + i_{\\rm dl}$ is equal to the movement of Li$^+$ ions into the anode, $i_{\\rm io}$.  Therefore, the electrolyte species concentrations are constant, in this relatively simple model, and can be stored as a parameter rather than a state variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boundary conditions:\n",
    "The primary boundary condition will be the applied current $i_{\\rm ext}$--this is the current at which the user charges the battery.\n",
    "\n",
    "While not technically a boundary condition, we will also assume that the electrolyte electric potential equals zero. We only care about the electric potentials in a _relative_ sense, and as such can set one of $\\phi_{\\rm anode}$ and $\\phi_{\\rm elyte,\\, anode}$ to the reference potential of zero (because it is the difference in electric potential which drives currents, the actual potential values are irrelevant). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the cathode potential will also be relative to the electrolyte potential, and so our cell voltage, were we simulating the entire cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{\\rm cell} = \\left(\\phi_{\\rm cathode} - \\phi_{\\rm elyte}\\right) -  \\left(\\phi_{\\rm anode} - \\phi_{\\rm elyte}\\right) =  \\phi_{\\rm cathode} - \\phi_{\\rm anode}$$\n",
    "is unaffected by our choice of a reference potential.\n",
